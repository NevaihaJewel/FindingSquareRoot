<h1>Square Root Calculator</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Developed a C program to assist with basic geometric measurements. The program prompts the user for two inputs, computes their sum, and then calculates the square of that sum. This project demonstrates my understanding of fundamental C programming concepts, including:

- Working with functions to modularize code for addition and squaring operations
- Handling user input and output using scanf and printf
- Implementing control flow and mathematical calculations
